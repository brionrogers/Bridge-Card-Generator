# Bridge-Card-Generator
Application used to generate training materials for teaching Contract Bridge.

#Introduction
This application is designed to create training materials to aid teaching the card game Contract Bridge. These images generated by this software are meant to be printed on the backs of cards. This application was developed as part of the Fall 2014 Software Engineering Management course at the University of West Florida.

#Overview
Users create 36 "boards" to fill a "deck"(not to be confused with a deck of 52 cards). Every deck has a name. Each board consists of 52 cards split evenly between 4 players. Each board has a dealer and a title. After a user compiles a "deck", they can generate images of the deck, one image per card in a 54 card(52 + 2 jokers that are printed but unused). Each image shows which player had the corresponding card in a particular board and which player was the dealer during that board. These images can be used to teach new and old players alike strategies for playing bridge in the event they encounter similiar "decks" in the future.  

#Compiling
To compile, toss the code in the "source_code" folder into you favorite Java IDE and add a reference to the itext-pdf.jar when compiling.
